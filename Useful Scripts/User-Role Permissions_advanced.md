# 1. User-Role Permissions (Advanced) ðŸ§©

Purpose: Inventory object privileges (tables, columns, sequences, schemas, databases, functions, languages, FDWs, foreign servers) across non-system schemas. Converts OIDs to human-readable role names (incl. PUBLIC) and exposes grantor/grantee, owner.

Key Points:
- Uses layered CTEs for object collection and ACL expansion (`aclexplode`).
- Normalizes grantor/grantee resolution (fallback to `pg_get_userbyid`).
- Easily extensible to add more object kinds.
- Final SELECT shows table privileges; adapt for others.

Refactoring:
- Added consistent inline comments.
- Grouped object collectors + ACL expansion.
- Kept recursion placeholder (login_roles + inheritance) though not used in final SELECTâ€”retain if you later add inherited role resolution.
