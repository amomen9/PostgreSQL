### AI Contributed Queries
For some useful queries like the "User/Role Permissions" one, the idea is mine, but the query has been written by AI. It has gone through
multiple tests to resolve compile-time and run-time errors, and also improved step-by-step. Above such scripts, it is written
"AI contributed script".
