### MORE GENERAL INFO ABOUT POSTGRESQL

• The PostgreSQL Object-relational Database Management System (ORDBMS) is a powerful, stable, open-source, free, and transactional database management system with diverse, powerful, abundant features, and the ability to be developed with various procedural languages. These languages include PL/PGSQL, PL/Python, PL/Tcl, and PL/Perl. This makes PostgreSQL accessible to a wide range of developers. Its object-oriented features simplify the work for programmers using object-oriented programming capabilities. Other features include diverse data types and operator overloading, allows developers to define indexes in a broader and more complex manner. This RDBMS is specifically designed for free and open-source Unix-based operating systems, including Linux, but it can be installed and used on all major operating systems, including Windows, Unix, macOS, Solaris, BSD systems, and more, both natively and in containers. Additionally, this ORDBMS is used on numerous devices. PostgreSQL belongs to and is maintained by EnterpriseDB (EDB). The main Linux distribution that EDB uses is RHEL (for example, RHEL itself, RockyLinux, OracleLinux, CEntOS, Fedora, Alma Linux, etc.), but PostgreSQL as noted is highly flexible with the hosting platform because it is widely used on numerous platforms. But some of the peripheral modules maintained by EDB are known to have some issues with some other platforms for example Ubuntu.

• Like its main host, Linux, PostgreSQL is highly customizable and can be managed with numerous peripheral extensions and modules, allowing users to add desired features to enhance this RDBMS as needed. Some of these extensions are exclusive for PostgreSQL, while some others are intended for many other applications, as well. However, this feature also makes its management more complex like Linux. PostgreSQL modules include both commercial and free ones, but they are mostly open-source and free.



• This RDBMS is very popular and has a large community of experts who contribute to the enhancement of PostgreSQL and its modules and help solve other experts' problems. PostgreSQL can be used for free at the enterprise level, and its main host, Linux, is also free, which is why many companies use it as their primary data storage system or one of their data storage systems. This RDBMS is currently very popular and has established a strong base for itself.
